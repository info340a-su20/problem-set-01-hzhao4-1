<body>
Baymax is an inflatable robot created to serve as a personal hhealthcare
companion. Following the death of his creater Tadashi Hamada, Baymax took

a team of other "geniuses" to save their hometown of San Fransokyo from

<h3> Reasons Why I Admire Baymax  </h3>
<body>
<li> From the first moment the character was introduced in the film, Baymax
caught my eyes. It was portrayed as a chubby, white, and squishy robot, similar
to that of a doll, except with many abilities such as monitoring others'
health. Its outer features gave me a feeling of comfort and pleasure.
</li>
<li> Other reasons I admire baymax is due to its bravery. Although it may be
  nothing more of a money-making robot to the villains, from the perspective
  of the creaters, it is bold in becoming a superhero to save the city,
  given his apparent, physical weaknesses.
</li>
<li> I also admire Baymax because it offers companion to its creaters. One of
  the scenes that struck me was when its creater Tadashi Hamada died, it not
  only was by his younger brother Hiro's side for a long time, but also offered
  hug to Hiro. Who would've thought that even robots can convey affection like
  such?
